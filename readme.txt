A simple plugin that shows you the performance of your posts on social media websites. 

== Description ==

When you click to Posts > All Posts in your Dashboard you’re shown all your posts. What you aren’t shown is how well these posts are doing on social media websites. WordPress Social adds a new column to your All Posts dashboard and clearly indicates which posts are being shared on social media websites.

With WordPress Social, you can quickly and easily see which of your posts are getting the most traction from social media websites. Through this information you can further optimise your posts for social media and ultimately get even more social shares.

> <strong>Publish Better Content</strong><br><br>
> Get more traffic to your website by writing more engaging content.<br>
> Find out which posts your audience appreciate the most.<br>
> Gain for authority (SEO) for your website.
